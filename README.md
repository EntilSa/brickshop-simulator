## 📖 About

Brickshop Simulator is a solo dev learning project where I'm building a 
shop management game from scratch using Unity and C#.

**Core concept:**
- Run a fictional building brick shop  
- Buy, repair, and sell collectible sets  
- Dynamic **"Out-of-Print"** mechanics (sets become rare over time)  
- Economic simulation with strategic decision-making  

**Personal goals:**
- Learn Unity 3D development  
- Practise C# programming & software architecture  
- Study game economy design  
- Build a portfolio project

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Engine:** Unity 2022 LTS  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Project Management:** Notion  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 📋 Development Approach

I’m following a structured roadmap:

1. **Pre-Production** (current) – planning, feature scoping, system design  
2. **Prototype** – core loop: buy, sell, basic economy  
3. **Vertical Slice** – 3D shop, customer AI, OOP mechanics  
4. **Alpha** – content, polish, balancing

## 🎮 What's This?

Manage a fictional LEGO-style brick shop. Buy wholesale pallets, repair damaged sets, and speculate on retired products that become valuable over time. 

**Core mechanics:**
- Buy rest stock and returns (mixed condition, incomplete sets)
- Sort, clean, and repair sets to increase value
- Dynamic **Out-of-Print system** - sets become rare over time
- Strategic pricing and inventory management

Built with **Unity & C#** as a learning project and portfolio piece.

**Current status:** Active pre-production (planning complete, development starts December 2025)
