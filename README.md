*A shop management simulation game focused on collectible building brick sets.*

## 🎮 What's This?

Manage a fictional brick shop with LEGO®-style building sets (unofficial, not affiliated with the LEGO Group).

**Core mechanics:**
- Buy rest stock and returns (mixed condition, incomplete sets)
- Sort, clean, and repair sets to increase value
- Dynamic Out-of-Print system - sets become rare over time
- Strategic pricing and inventory management

Built with Unity & C# as a learning project and portfolio piece.

**Current status:** Active pre-production (planning complete, development starts December 2025)
